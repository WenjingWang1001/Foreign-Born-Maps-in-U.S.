# Foreign-Born-Maps-in-U.S.
This is a easy interactive map application built with R leaflet and R shiny.

# Features
Build useful web applications with only a few lines of codeâ€”no JavaScript required.

Shiny applications are automatically "live" in the same way that spreadsheets are live. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser.

Shiny user interfaces can be built entirely using R, or can be written directly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for more flexibility.
Works in any R environment (Console R, Rgui for Windows or Mac, ESS, StatET, RStudio, etc.).

Through exploring this interactive map, you will get a sense of what the top 10 countries of birth among Foreign Born in MA are and where they live currently (based on American Commmunity Survey 2018 data from Census of Bueau).
